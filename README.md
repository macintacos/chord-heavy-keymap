# Chord Heavy - A keymap inspired by [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/)

**NOTE** - This extension is being "discontinued" and archived in favor of [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode). Please download that extension instead; you'll get a very robust Spacemacs-esque configuration out of the box and be happier than using the compromise that is this keymap.

The "old" README is available [here](./OLD_README.md) if you'd still like to refer to it. I'd still like to advocate for the [issues that I'd noted there as well](./OLD_README.md##issues-to-vote-for); please vote for them!
